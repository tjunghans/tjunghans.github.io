These are my notes on "Think & Grow Rich" by Napolean Hill (ISBN 0-449-21492-3).

### Chapter 1: Thoughts are things

Thoughts are powerful when mixed with purpose, persistence and desire.

Desire has to be definite. 

You need to believe that your desire can become reality.

Be willing to stake your entire future.

What you think counts more than your appearance.

You need to keep intensifying desire even if progress is at a stand still.

Opportunity can present itself in sly and disguised ways.

Opportunity often comes in the form of temporary defeat or misfortune.

An intangible impulse of thought can be transmuted into material rewards by the application of known principles ????.

You can think yourself into success.

Don't accept "No" for an answer.

Temporary defeat is almost inevitable before success.

One sound idea is all one needs to achieve success.

One of mankinds great weaknesses is the average man's familiarity with the word
"impossible".

We tend know very well what does not work and cannot be done.

Success comes to those who become success concious.

Failure comes to those who allow themselves to become failure concious.

The need to measure everything and everyone by their own impressions and beliefs
 is another weakness found in too many people.

We refuse to believe what we don't understand.

"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul" - William Ernest Henley

We have the power to control our thoughts.

Our brains become magnetized with the dominating thoughts which we hold in our mind.

Maintain a spirit of open-mindedness.

### Chapter 2: Desire

Thoughts matter more than appearance.

Desire is not *hope* and it is not *wish*.

Success is the result of a definitive goal that receives all your energy, will
power and effort.

Focus on one thing. Ignore other opportunities.

Win or perish. Burn bridges to get to your goal if you have to. Turning back
must not be an option.

Wishing will not bring riches.

Desires with an obsessed state of mind, definite planning backed by persistence
which does not recognize failure will bring riches.

#### Six ways to turn desires into gold

1. Fix in your mind the exact amount of money desired.
2. Determine what you will give in return for the desired amount of money. 
   (Nothing is for free.)
3. Set a definitive date by when you intend the possess the amount of money.
4. Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire.
5. Write statement about the amount of desired money, how it will be acquired and
   by when.
6. Read the written statement aloud twice a day, once before bed and once as soon
  as you are awake. See, feel and believe yourself already in possession of the 
  desired amount of money.

The six steps above are important.

The application of the six steps calls for sufficient imagination.

Dreaming, hoping, wishing and desiring are prerequisites for great success.

You will not possess unless you work yourself into a white heat of desire.

To win one must possess definiteness of purpose, knowledge of what one wants and
the burning desire to own it.

Practical dreamers do not quit.

The world is filled with an abundance of opportunity.

All who succeeed in life get off to a bad start and pass through many heartbreaking
struggles before success.

It's darkest before dawn.

No one is defeated until defeat is accepted and reality.

No one is ready for a thing until he believes he can require it.

Desire outwits mother nature.

A truly burning desire has devious ways of transmuting itself into its physical
equivalent.

> Both proverty and riches are the offspring of thought
