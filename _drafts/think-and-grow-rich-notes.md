These are my notes on "Think & Grow Rich" by Napolean Hill (ISBN 0-449-21492-3).

### Chapter 1: Thoughts are things

Thoughts are powerful when mixed with purpose, persistence and desire.

Desire has to be definite.

You need to believe that your desire can become reality.

Be willing to stake your entire future.

What you think counts more than your appearance.

You need to keep intensifying desire even if progress is at a stand still.

Opportunity can present itself in sly and disguised ways.

Opportunity often comes in the form of temporary defeat or misfortune.

An intangible impulse of thought can be transmuted into material rewards by the application of known principles ????.

You can think yourself into success.

Don't accept "No" for an answer.

Temporary defeat is almost inevitable before success.

One sound idea is all one needs to achieve success.

One of mankinds great weaknesses is the average man's familiarity with the word
"impossible".

We tend know very well what does not work and cannot be done.

Success comes to those who become success concious.

Failure comes to those who allow themselves to become failure concious.

The need to measure everything and everyone by their own impressions and beliefs
is another weakness found in too many people.

We refuse to believe what we don't understand.

"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul" - William Ernest Henley

We have the power to control our thoughts.

Our brains become magnetized with the dominating thoughts which we hold in our mind.

Maintain a spirit of open-mindedness.

### Chapter 2: Desire

Thoughts matter more than appearance.

Desire is not _hope_ and it is not _wish_.

Success is the result of a definitive goal that receives all your energy, will
power and effort.

Focus on one thing. Ignore other opportunities.

Win or perish. Burn bridges to get to your goal if you have to. Turning back
must not be an option.

Wishing will not bring riches.

Desires with an obsessed state of mind, definite planning backed by persistence
which does not recognize failure will bring riches.

#### Six ways to turn desires into gold

1. Fix in your mind the exact amount of money desired.
2. Determine what you will give in return for the desired amount of money.
   (Nothing is for free.)
3. Set a definitive date by when you intend the possess the amount of money.
4. Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire.
5. Write statement about the amount of desired money, how it will be acquired and
   by when.
6. Read the written statement aloud twice a day, once before bed and once as soon
   as you are awake. See, feel and believe yourself already in possession of the
   desired amount of money.

The six steps above are important.

The application of the six steps calls for sufficient imagination.

Dreaming, hoping, wishing and desiring are prerequisites for great success.

You will not possess unless you work yourself into a white heat of desire.

To win one must possess definiteness of purpose, knowledge of what one wants and
the burning desire to own it.

Practical dreamers do not quit.

The world is filled with an abundance of opportunity.

All who succeeed in life get off to a bad start and pass through many heartbreaking
struggles before success.

It's darkest before dawn.

No one is defeated until defeat is accepted and reality.

No one is ready for a thing until he believes he can require it.

Desire outwits mother nature.

A truly burning desire has devious ways of transmuting itself into its physical
equivalent.

> There are no limitations to the mind except those we acknolwedge

> Both proverty and riches are the offspring of thought

### Chapter 3: Faith

Faith is the head chemist of the mind.

Faith, love and sex are the most powerful of all the major positive emotions.

When faith, love and sex are blended they can change a thought so that it instantly
reaches the subconcious mind.

Faith is a state of mind, induced or created by autosuggestion.

The goal is to transmute the intangible thought impulse of desire into its physical
counterpart, money.

> Repetition of affirmation of orders to your subconcious mind is the only known
> method of voluntary development of the emotion of faith.

Any impulse of thought which is repeatedly passed on to the subconcious mind is
finally and accepted and accted upon by the subconcous mind.

All thoughts which have been emotionalized and mixed with with faith will translate themselves
into their physical equivalent.

There is nothing hindering you from "deceiving" your subconcious mind when giving
it instructions through auto suggestion.

To deceive your subconcious mind act as though you already posses what you are
asking for.

Encourage positive emotions.

Discourage and eliminate negative emotions.

The subconcious mind will translate into reality a thought driven by fear just
as readily as it will translate into reality a thought driven by courage or faith.

If you think you can, you can.

Faith is a state of mind which may be induced by autosuggestion.

Faith is the external elixir which gives life, power and action to the impulse of
thought.

If a man repeats a lie over and over, he will eventually accept the lie as truth.

The human mind is constantly attracting vibrations which harmonize with that
which dominiates the mind.

Any idea, plan or purpose may be placed in the mind through repetion of thought.

Write out a statement of your major purpose, or ultimate goal. Commit it to memory.
Repeat it.

Resolve to throw off the influences of any unfortunate environment.

Take inventory of mental assets and liabilities.

You may discover that your greatest weakness is lack of self-confidence.

Overcome lack of self-confidence by translating timidity into courage using 
autosuggestion.

#### Self-Confidence Formula

First:
Know that you can achieve what you desire. Demand of yourself persistence, 
continuous action towards its atainment.

Second:
Realize your dominating thoughts will eventually translate to phyisical reality.
Concentrate on your thoughts for 30 minutes daily. Think of the person you intend
to become and create a clear, mental picture.



> Thoughts which are mixed with any of the feelings of emotions, consitute a
> "magnetic" force which atracts other similar or related thoughts.

"miracles" are produced through the state of mind known as faith.

Riches begin with thought.
