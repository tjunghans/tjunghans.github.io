These are my notes on "Think & Grow Rich" by Napolean Hill (ISBN 0-449-21492-3).

### Chapter 1: Thoughts are things

Thoughts are powerful when mixed with purpose, persistence and desire.

Desire has to be definite. 

You need to believe that your desire can become reality.

Be willing to stake your entire future.

What you think counts more than your appearance.

You need to keep intensifying desire even if progress is at a stand still.

Opportunity can present itself in sly and disguised ways.

Opportunity often comes in the form of temporary defeat or misfortune.

An intangible impulse of thought can be transmuted into material rewards by the application of known principles ????.

You can think yourself into success.

Don't accept "No" for an answer.

Temporary defeat is almost inevitable before success.

One sound idea is all one needs to achieve success.

One of mankinds great weaknesses is the average man's familiarity with the word
"impossible".

We tend know very well what does not work and cannot be done.

Success comes to those who become success concious.

Failure comes to those who allow themselves to become failure concious.

The need to measure everything and everyone by their own impressions and beliefs
 is another weakness found in too many people.

We refuse to believe what we don't understand.

"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul" - William Ernest Henley

We have the power to control our thoughts.

Our brains become magnetized with the dominating thoughts which we hold in our mind.

Maintain a spirit of open-mindedness.

### Chapter 2: Desire

Practical dreamers do not quit.

The world is filled with an abundance of opportunity.
