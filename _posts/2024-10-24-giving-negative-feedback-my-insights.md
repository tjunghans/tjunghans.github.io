## Prepare for feedback
Begin by outlining the situation, then identify the assumptions held by yourself and others on the person the feedback is for. I found that reflecting on these assumptions after detailing the situation prompted me to refine my description.

## Acknowledge the difficulty
Recognize that these conversations can be challenging for everyone involved. It’s completely valid for the recipient of negative feedback to sense that the giver is also experiencing discomfort.

## Consider external factors
Be out of the box. Remember that everyone is human, with their own needs, hopes, and concerns — not just roles to fulfill.

## Build trust and show care
This aligns with Kim Scott’s principles in Radical Candor. Her mantra of “care personally, challenge directly” emphasizes the importance of genuine concern in fostering open communication.

## Use inclusive language
Opt for “we” instead of “I” and “you.” Focus on how we can collaboratively improve the situation based on the feedback and the benefits that will arise from it.

## Embrace constructive feedback
Well-received critical feedback is an opportunity for growth — it’s like steering the wheel towards the right direction. We should appreciate those who have the courage to offer us such insights.
