title:  Stay at Your Job for Three Years Before Moving On

As a team lead overseeing software engineers, one of the key things I evaluate when reviewing resumes is the length of time an engineer has spent at previous companies, especially when they’ve held roles for three years or longer.

I believe that engineers who switch jobs every six to twelve months may be missing out on valuable opportunities for growth. They often don't have the chance to fully experience the long-term impact of their contributions—whether those impacts are positive or negative, both of which are essential for professional development. By the time they’ve gotten through the initial ramp-up phase and start making real progress, they’re moving on. This not only creates a high cost for the engineer but also for the team that’s left behind.

Recruiting and hiring software engineers who are a good fit for the team and company culture is both challenging and expensive. While it’s certainly less costly than hiring the wrong person, that’s a conversation for another time.


## Settling In, Impact, Growth, and Rewards

### The First Year: Settling In
The first year is about acclimating to the company—learning the people, the processes, and understanding how things operate over the course of an entire fiscal year. It’s about getting grounded in the role and establishing a solid foundation.

### The Second Year: Making an Impact
The second year is when an engineer starts to make their mark. The "new person" phase is over, and they take full ownership of their work. This is when the engineer begins to shape their reputation, build trust, and contribute meaningfully to the team’s success.

### The Third Year: Growth and Reaping Rewards
By the third year, the engineer has a deep understanding of the company, its technologies, and its challenges. They are often the go-to person for specific applications or technical problems, earning the trust of colleagues and gaining additional freedoms. This phase brings greater fulfillment, as the engineer can see the tangible results of their hard work and take on more significant challenges.


## Rinse and Repeat

This cycle of settling in, making an impact, and growing can continue without leaving the company. Engineers can switch teams, take on new projects, explore different roles, or expand their responsibilities. Staying with a company long enough to fully grow into these opportunities not only benefits the engineer but also the company, fostering deeper expertise, stronger relationships, and a more cohesive culture.
