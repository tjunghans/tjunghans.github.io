I prioritize progress over goals. 

By goals I mean long term goals, such as running a marathon and owning a business.

Goals like these tend to be overwhelming because they are hard to achieve.

I've given up on going to the gym. 

For me *being* at the gym is the easy part. 

It's *getting ready for* and *going* to the gym that require more discipline than I'm willing to spend.

Anything that challenges my discipline too much risks of not being done.

I prefer to do what I can do consistently.

I do what works. Rather little instead nothing.

One pushup a day are 365 push ups a year. 

50 push ups a day are 18'250 push ups
a year but doing 50 push ups a day requires far more discipline and you're likely
to skip a day or two or more.

## Checklist

Below is an example of my daily checklist. 

The items should be specific and realistic.

Don't add an item that is not consistently doable on a daily basis. 

Don't add too many items so that you end up missing a few.

- [ ] List at least one thing you're grateful for
- [ ] Show appreciation to your loved ones
- [ ] No coffee after 1pm
- [ ] Eat carbs, fat and protein with each meal
- [ ] 1 minute of pushups
- [ ] 1 minute of squats

- [ ] 1 minute of lunges
- [ ] 1 minute of stretching
- [ ] 1 minute of planking
- [ ] 1 minute of jumping jacks
- [ ] Medidate for 5 minutes
