I prioritize progress over goals. 

By goals I mean long term goals, such as running a marathon and owning a business.

Goals like these tend to be overwhelming because they are hard to achieve.

I've given up on going to the gym. 

For me *being* at the gym is the easy part. 

It's *getting ready for* and *going* to the gym that challenge my discipline.

Anything that challenges my discipline too much risks of not being done.

I prefer to do what I can do consistently.

I do what works. Rather little instead nothing.

One pushup a day are 365 push ups a year. 

50 push ups a day are 18'250 push ups
a year but doing 50 push ups a day requires far more discipline and you're likely
to skip a day or two or more.

## Checklist

- [ ] List at least one thing you're grateful for
- [ ] Show appreciation to your loved ones
- [ ] No coffee after 1pm
- [ ] Ate carb, fat and protein with each meal
- [ ] 1 minute of pushups
- [ ] 1 minute of squats
- [ ] 1 minute of situps
- [ ] 1 minute of lunges
- [ ] 1 minute of stretching
- [ ] Medidate for 5 minutes
- [ ] Read 1 page of a book

The above is an example of a daily checklist. 

The items should be specific and realistic.

The items should be consistently doable on a daily basis.
