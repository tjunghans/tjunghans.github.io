      <h2>Three different countries</h2>
      <p>
        I was born in South Africa. At the age of three my father moved us back
        to his country of birth, southern Germany. Six years later we moved back
        to South Africa. When I was 16 we moved back to Europe and settled in
        Switzerland.
